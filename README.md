# Hello World! 👋

I'm @addevin, a passionate MEAN Stack developer currently working at zilmoney.com. I have a keen interest in coding through the night, exploring the vast realms of technology.

- 👀 I'm intrigued by the magic that happens in the wee hours of the night when lines of code come to life.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm immersed in the MEAN Stack, crafting solutions and experiences.
- 💞️ I'm always open to collaborate, especially with my favorite coding partner—myself! 😄
